# University project, First stage, basic funcianality

## Desc
This project is supposed to query number of huge xls files
I use TTL and Linq to make it just as fast as possible
Calculating a total of specific records in specific files (we're talking thousands of thousands)
takes less than a second with this sollution. I will continue to work on this
